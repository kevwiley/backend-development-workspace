# backend-development-workspace
My name is Kevin Wiley, the purpose of this repository is for my application development class' assignments.

## Overview
This repository is where my file related to my assignments are going to be stored. There are folders set up for each individual unit, and multiple markdown files for storing resources such as development links and git commands.

## Learning Objectives
My learning objective in this class are to learn about the APIs used in applications, and how to manage and make use of them. I also want to learn about using and implementing databases using SQL. Finally I want to be able to put all of these skills together to create a project I can use to show my skills to employers.

## Plans to Use Repository
This repository is going to be used throughout the semester to keep my assignments and any changes made to them organized. I will also be able to store any useful links and commands I find in the repository as well. Finally the repository will be useful as well as a reference for my work.
